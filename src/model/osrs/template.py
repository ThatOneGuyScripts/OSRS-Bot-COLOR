           when the bot has made a mistake, gets stuck, or a condition is met that requires the bot to stop.
        2. Frequently call self.update_progress() and self.log_msg() to send information to the UI.
        3. At the end of the main loop, make sure to call `self.stop()`.

        Additional notes:
        - Make use of Bot/RuneLiteBot member functions. There are many functions to simplify various actions.
          Visit the Wiki for more.
        - Using the available APIs is highly recommended. Some of all of the API tools may be unavailable for
          select private servers. To see what the APIs can offer you, see here: https://github.com/kelltom/OSRS-Bot-COLOR/tree/main/src/utilities/api.
          For usage, uncomment the `api_m` and/or `api_s` lines below, and use the `.` operator to access their
